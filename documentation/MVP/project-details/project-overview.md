# **Project Overview**

## **Project Name**
**Sage**

## **Purpose**
Sage is a volunteer social platform that connects people with local volunteer opportunities and allows users to invite friends. It provides tools for users to browse events, RSVP, track their impact, and build a volunteer community.

## **Problem**
Volunteers struggle to find and commit to local volunteer opportunities, while organizations face challenges recruiting and retaining volunteers. Current platforms lack user-friendly design, tracking, and engagement features.

## **Solution**
Sage makes volunteering simple and engaging. Users can **find, RSVP, invite friends, and track volunteer events**, while organizations can **create, manage, and promote their events**. Gamification elements like badges, progress tracking, and user profiles motivate users to stay active.

- **Event Organizers**: Create and manage events, recruit volunteers, and gather reviews.

## **Core Features**
- **User Profiles**: Users manage their personal info, event history, badges, and preferences.
- **Event Listings**: Browse, search, and filter volunteer opportunities by location, date, and event type.
- **RSVP**: RSVP for events with statuses like **Interested**, **Not Interested**, or **Maybe**.
- **Invites**: Users can send event invites to friends and track invite responses.
- **Impact Tracking**: View badges, earned milestones, and a progress tracker.
- **Reviews**: Leave and view feedback for event organizers.
- **Notifications & Reminders**: Receive alerts and reminders for RSVPâ€™d events and changes.
